## ⚡️ Protect Your Code. Stop Malicious Packages.

We scan the **code you didn’t write** — before it reaches your codebase.  
SafeDep protects you from malicious code hidden in open source packages you install every day.  
We **guard the entry point**, not just the code inside.  

---

## 🔎 What We Do

### 🛡 Guarding External Code First
We address the real starting point of supply chain risk — third-party open source dependencies — by stopping malicious code before it ever reaches your repository.

### ⚙️ Invisible in Your Workflow
SafeDep runs directly inside your terminal and CI/CD pipeline.  
No extra dashboards. No context switching.  
Just **security that operates silently in the background**.

### 🔍 Trust Through Transparency
We are **open source by default**, with no vendor lock-in.  
You can see exactly:
- What we scan  
- Why a package is flagged  
- How decisions are made  

Transparency builds trust — and trust is what open source depends on.
